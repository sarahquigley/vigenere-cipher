* Include the browser, browser version, OS, OS version and device where you experienced the problem.
* Include screenshots and / or other supplementary material, whenever relevant and possible; they are very helpful.
* If possible, check the browser's Javascript console and report any errors that may be associated with the problem you have observed. 
* If you can, include a unit test (see the [Spec Styleguide](#spec-styleguide) below for details) that shows how the expected behaviour is not occurring. This can be included as part of the issue description, or as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/).

* Fully describe the change(s) made by your pull request.
* Link to any related issues or pull requests.
* Include screenshots and / or other supporting material in your pull request, whenever possible.
* Resolve any code conflicts. 
* Follow the [CoffeeScript](#coffeescript-styleguide), and [SCSS](#scss-styleguide) styleguides (once these exist!).
* Include thorough [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) unit tests written in CoffeeScript. See the [Spec Styleguide](#spec-styleguide) below for details.

## Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature" or "Adds feature").

# SCSS Styleguide

Coming soon!

## Spec Styleguide

* Write informative, well-structured [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) unit tests.
* Name specs according to the following convention: '*.spec.coffee'. 
* Place specs in a `spec` folder of the feature/module you are working on, if present.
* Feel free to create a `spec` folder when specs for a feature/module, become sufficiently numerous.
* If a method is private method of a class, it does not strictly require unit testing.
* Treat `describe` as a noun or situation (often the name of class or method).
* Treat `it` as a statement about state or how an operation changes state.
* For instructions on how to to run specs, see information on the project's grunt tasks in our [README](https://github.com/sarahquigley/vigenere-cipher#grunt-tasks).

### Example

Sample code to be tested:
```coffee
class Cat
  constructor: (@mood='sleepy') ->

  make_noise: =>
  if @mood is 'sleepy'
    @purr()
  else
    @miaow()

  # Private methods
  _miaow: =>
    # code for miaowing here

  _purr: =>
    # code for purring here
```

Sample spec:
```coffee
describe 'Cat', ->
  describe '#make_noise', ->
    describe 'when the cat is sleepy', ->
      it 'should purr', ->
        # spec here
    describe 'when the cat is not sleepy', ->
      it 'should miaow', ->
        # spec here
```
